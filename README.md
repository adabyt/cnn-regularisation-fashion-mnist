# CNN with Regularisation on Fashion MNIST

This project builds on the base CNN model from [this repo](https://github.com/adabyt/tensorflow-cnn-fashion-mnist), extending it with **Batch Normalisation** and **Dropout** to improve generalisation and reduce overfitting. The model is trained and evaluated on the [Fashion MNIST dataset](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

---

## Overview

The CNN architecture integrates:
- **Batch Normalisation** after convolutional and dense layers  
- **Dropout** (tunable rate) after the dense activation layer

These additions aim to:
- Accelerate training  
- Improve convergence  
- Prevent overfitting on the training set  

---

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Fashion MNIST dataset:
- 60,000 training samples, 10,000 test samples
- 28×28 grayscale images across **10 classes**:
  `['T-shirt/top', 'Trouser', 'Pullover', 'Dress', 'Coat', 'Sandal', 'Shirt', 'Sneaker', 'Bag', 'Ankle boot']`

## Notes on Regularisation & Training

### Model Training Observations

- **Validation accuracy** is comparable to the unregularised CNN.
- **Validation loss** is **lower** and more stable — a sign of better generalisation.
- **Training accuracy** and **training loss** are slightly worse than the previous CNN — a good sign, as the model is **not overfitting**.

*The regularised model generalises better and is less likely to memorise training data.*

### Dropout Rate Experiments

| Dropout Rate | Test Accuracy | Test Loss | Epoch w/ Lowest Validation Loss |
|--------------|---------------|-----------|----------------------------------|
| `0.2`        | 0.9102        | 0.2941    | 7                                |
| `0.3`        | 0.9098        | 0.2677    | 7                                |
| `0.4`        | 0.9073        | 0.2840    | 9                                |
| `0.5`        | 0.9066        | 0.2695    | 9                                |
| _Previous CNN_ | 0.9101      | 0.2874    | 7                                |

**Interpretation**:
- A **lower dropout rate** consistently yields **better accuracy and lower loss**.
- This may suggest:
  - The model benefits from **more node interconnectivity** on this dataset.
  - Higher dropout introduces too much noise and degrades performance.

## Final Evaluation

- **Test Accuracy**: ~0.9066  
- **Test Loss**: ~0.2695  
- First 5 predictions matched the true labels perfectly
